# Trust Rank Folder

This folder contains files related to the Trust Rank algorithm implementation. Below is a brief description of each file:

1. **bad_sender.csv**: This CSV file contains data regarding potentially unreliable senders.

2. **Payments.csv**: This file contains payment data of sender/receiver and the amount of transaction.

3. **results.txt**: The results of scores of each node (sender/receiver) are stored in this text file. 

4. **score_distribution.png**: This image file visualizes the distribution of Trust Rank scores. It provides a graphical representation of how scores are distributed across the dataset.

5. **score_distribution_frequency.png**: Another image file depicting the frequency of Trust Rank scores. This visualization can offer additional insights into the distribution patterns of scores.

6. **TrustRank.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and analysis scripts used to implement the Trust Rank algorithm. It provides a comprehensive view of the methodology and calculations involved.

7. **trustRank_Report**: This file contains a detailed report of the Trust Rank algorithm problem statement, dataset description, algorithm, results, and findings.
